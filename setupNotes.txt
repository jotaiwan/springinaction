IntelliJ does not show 'Class' when we right click and select 'New'

The directory or one of the parent directories must be marked as Source Root (In this case, it appears in blue).

If this is not the case, right click your root source directory (eg. josimple) -> Mark As -> Source Root.

intellij - spring is not being recognized (Unmapped Spring configuration)

Go to the project structure dialog (either by clicking the warning or through file=>project structure
select the modules item in the left hand list
go through and right click on the modules with missing files and select Add=>Spring
in the new tab click the + button
you should now see a list of the xml files. Check the boxes next to them
I'm not entirely clear what this achieves apart from getting rid of the warnings! If anyone could shed any light on that it'd be good.
